[DevAAC](https://github.com/DevelopersPL/DevAAC) is the best AAC for [TFS 1.0+](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver), written with good coding practices in mind and lots of love for development!
It supports **only** TFS 1.0+, so if you really want to use other/older buggy engines, it's probably not useful for you.
